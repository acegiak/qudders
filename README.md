# Qudders

## Developing

The following steps are optional but useful:

- Install the `dotnet` command.
- Copy or symbolic link `Assembly-CSharp.dll` and `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll` from your *Caves of Qud* installation into this mod's directory. (These are ignored by this project's git settings.)

Now you can `dotnet build` to error check the code and also use Visual Studio Code's code completion.
